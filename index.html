            <h2>A Short Introduction</h2>
            We are a group friends who share a passion in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). These interests have brought us together in life, and everyday developments in these fields aid us in our work. Fortunate to have grown up in the age of computers and touchscreens, we hope to pay our elders back by offering open-forum-like sessions at our local libraries where we hope to help seniors understand technology better, whether to stay in touch with loved ones or just to keep up with the times.
            
            Below are some quick links to find where we'll be, resources, and contact information.
